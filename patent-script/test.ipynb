      "FIELD OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "\n",
      "The present invention relates to the field of directed self-assembly, also called DSA (from the English acronym “Directed Self-Assembly”), nanolithography.\n",
      "\n",
      "More particularly, the invention relates to a prepolymer composition intended to be crosslinked and used as a contrast layer in a polymer stack.\n",
      "\n",
      "The invention further relates to a top coat-like interface material, intended to be deposited on a block copolymer film, and more particularly to the structuring of such a material.\n",
      "\n",
      "PRIOR ART\n",
      "\n",
      "In the field of directed self-assembly, or DSA, nanolithography, block copolymers, capable of nanostructuring at an assembly temperature, are used as nanolithography masks. To do this, systems of stacks of liquid/viscous materials are used. These stacks comprise a solid substrate10, as shown inFIG.1, on which is deposited at least one film20of block copolymer, subsequently denoted BCP. This block copolymer BCP film, intended to form a nanolithography mask, is necessarily in a liquid/viscous state at the assembly temperature, so it can self-organize into nanodomains, due to a phase segregation between the blocks. By “liquid or viscous polymer” is meant a polymer which has, at a temperature above the glass transition temperature, as a result of its rubbery state, an increased capacity for deformation due to the possibility given to its molecular chains to move freely. However, hydrodynamic phenomena at the origin of dewetting appear as long as the material is not in a solid state, that is to say non-deformable due to the negligible mobility of its molecular chains. This dewetting phenomenon is characterized by the spontaneous shrinkage of the polymer film applied to the surface of the underlying layer, when the initial stack system is left to evolve freely over time. Loss of continuity of the initial film and a variation in thickness then arise. The film does not spread and forms one or more spherical caps/droplets, giving rise to a non-zero contact angle with the underlying surface. Consequently, since the block copolymer film deposited on the surface of the substrate10is in a liquid/viscous state to be able to self-organize at the assembly temperature, it is therefore subject to dewetting phenomena when brought to its assembly temperature.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of directed self-assembly nanolithography of block copolymers, a flat, that is to say no dewet, block copolymer film is sought with nanodomains21,22perpendicular to the interfaces in order to be able to transfer these nanodomains into the underlying substrate10to create dimensionally controlled patterns, useful for microelectronics applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where appropriate, it is desirable to be able to obtain preferential areas on the block copolymer film where only those areas have perpendicular patterns, and where the entire film has not dewet.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to address these issues, the applicant showed, in patent applications FR 3 074 180 and FR 3 074 179, that the crosslinking of top coat, subsequently denoted TC, films with neutral affinity with respect to the blocks of the underlying block copolymer, allowed flat block copolymer films and top coat films to be obtained, thanks to the mechanical stress imposed by crosslinking the top coat. To this end, a crosslinking activator, such as a photo-generated acid PAG, a photo-generated base PBG, or a radical generator for example, is incorporated into the pre-TC top coat material and an appropriate stimulation of the activator, for example by UV radiation or an electron beam or thermal treatment, allows the top coat film TC to be crosslinked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such crosslinking of the top coat film can furthermore be carried out in a localized manner, through a lithography mask, in order to obtain localized crosslinking of the top coat with areas crosslinked and neutral with respect to the underlying block copolymer blocks, referenced Z1inFIG.1, and non-crosslinked areas. Such localized crosslinking is intended to create specific areas in the underlying block copolymer20, located under the crosslinked neutral areas Z1of the top coat TC1, where the nanodomains are oriented perpendicular to the substrate surface after annealing at the assembly temperature. However, in this case, the method followed to create specific areas of the block copolymer where the nanodomains are oriented perpendicular to the substrate surface is difficult to implement. Indeed, after the lithography step, allowing some areas Z1of the top coat TC1to be locally crosslinked, it is necessary to remove the non-irradiated and thus non-crosslinked areas Z2of top coat material TC1, and then replenish these with a second top coat TC2of an affinity opposite to the first one (that is to say if the first TC1is neutral, then the second TC2is non-neutral, and vice versa), and crosslink this second top coat TC2in order to obtain the flatness of the underlying block copolymer film20in these same areas. Conversely, if a second top coat TC2is not used and then crosslinked to ensure flatness of the underlying BCP film, the block copolymer may be free to dewet from these areas, which can be problematic when reduced thicknesses of the first top coat TC1are used.\n",
      "\n",
      "The method described in these patent applications is therefore efficient, but time-consuming and costly to implement. It therefore appears necessary to find an even more efficient way for combining the different key points defining a top coat material for DSA, namely at least:orthogonality of the solvents of the top coat with respect to the underlying block copolymer,crosslinking properties of the top coat, to ensure flatness of the underlying block copolymer film,availability and reasonable method of synthesis of the constituents of the top coat material and of the material itself,homogeneity of the material when dispensed on the block copolymer film,property of neutrality and non-neutrality to the underlying block copolymer, andreduced number of steps necessary to obtain the final block copolymer pattern.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, a secondary technical problem arises with regard to the whole method followed for obtaining areas of interest in the block copolymer, where the nanodomains are oriented perpendicular to the substrate. Indeed, when a second top coat TC2is dispensed on an already crosslinked first area Z1of a first top coat TC1and on the adjacent holes (areas Z2of the first top coat TC1which are not crosslinked and are hollowed out by rinsing in a solvent), a significant difference in thickness is created between the initially crosslinked areas Z1(top coat TC1thickness+top coat TC2thickness) and the areas Z2which are hollowed out and filled only with the second crosslinked top coat TC2(top coat TC2thickness). This difference in thickness is detrimental to the final integration of the block copolymer film. Indeed, since the top coats TC1and TC2are removed by plasma etching, a plasma process is required which can effectively etch both top coats TC1and TC2, but which has a barrier layer at the top of the block copolymer film, otherwise the initial thickness difference between the two top coats, (TC1+TC2) on the one hand, and TC2on the other hand, can be at least partially transferred into the block copolymer film, making it more complex to use in the final application. However, it appears very difficult to find plasma conditions (gas chemistry, reactor type, parameters to be applied) allowing for a barrier layer on the block copolymer, even when the chemistries of the top coats and the different phases of the block copolymer are very dissimilar. It therefore appears necessary to also have a minimal difference in thickness between the different neutral and non-neutral areas of the top coats TC1+TC2and TC2, respectively, in order to facilitate the implementation of the block copolymer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consequently, in the context of using stacks comprising block copolymers BCP in the form of thin films, intended to be used as nanolithography masks, for applications in organic electronics, it is imperative to be able to control not only that the block copolymer BCP film entirely covers the surface of the substrate under consideration without dewetting thereof, and that the top coat layer entirely covers the surface of the block copolymer without dewetting, but also that the top coat-like layer, deposited at the upper interface, can be structured in such a way as to have adjacent areas, the affinity with the blocks of the underlying block copolymer of which is the opposite, in order to obtain a block copolymer after nanostructuring with areas, the patterns of which are perpendicular to the interfaces, and areas where the patterns are parallel to the interfaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "More generally, the applicant sought a solution to obtain a prepolymer composition intended to be crosslinked and form a contrast layer. Such a contrast layer can then be used in polymer stacks. In the context of the field of directed assembly DSA nanolithography, the contrast layer can, for example, form a top coat-like interface material layer deposited on a block copolymer, with the contrast being formed from adjacent areas, the affinity for the blocks of the underlying block copolymer of which is the opposite.\n",
      "\n",
      "Technical Problem\n",
      "\n",
      "The aim of the invention is thus to overcome at least one of the drawbacks of the prior art. In particular, the invention aims at providing a prepolymer composition intended to be crosslinked and form a contrast layer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The invention also aims to provide a simple and effective method for structuring a top coat-like interface material, intended to be deposited on a block copolymer film and crosslinked to provide sufficient stress to prevent dewetting of said underlying block copolymer, said method further providing a chemical contrast within the interface material, by creating adjacent areas having an opposite affinity with respect to each other for the blocks of the underlying block copolymer.\n",
      "\n",
      "BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "\n",
      "To this end, one object of the invention is a prepolymer composition intended to be crosslinked and form a contrast layer, said composition being characterized in that it comprises, on the one hand, a prepolymer comprising a plurality of functional monomers, and at least one crosslinkable functional group within its polymer chain and, on the other hand, two chemically different crosslinking agents, each agent being capable of initiating the crosslinking of said prepolymer in response to a stimulation specific thereto.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to other optional characteristics of the prepolymer composition, the latter may optionally include one or more of the following features, alone or in combination:one of the crosslinking agents, is able to react with a crosslinkable functional group and also with a functional monomer of the polymer chain. Such an additional reaction significantly increases the chemical contrast between the primary and secondary crosslinked areas, and thus the affinity contrast with respect to the blocks of the underlying block copolymereach crosslinking agent and reacts with a different crosslinkable functional group. Hence that the resulting contrast between the primary and secondary crosslinked areas is further enhancedboth crosslinking agents and are carried by the polymer chain and each agent reacts with a different crosslinkable functional group.one of the crosslinking agents, in addition to reacting with a crosslinkable functional group, different from the crosslinkable group with which the second crosslinking agent reacts, also reacts with a functional monomer of the polymer chain allowing to further increase the chemical contrast between the primary and secondary crosslinked areas\n",
      "\n",
      "Another object of the invention is a method for structuring an interface material deposited on a block copolymer film, said method being characterized in that it comprises the following steps:depositing, on said block copolymer film, a prepolymer composition layer comprising, on the one hand, a plurality of functional monomers and at least one crosslinkable functional group within its polymer chain and, on the other hand, two chemically different crosslinking agents, each agent being capable of initiating the crosslinking of said prepolymer in response to a stimulation specific thereto,subjecting the stack thus created to a first stimulation localized on first areas, said first stimulation being selected from light radiation, ion bombardment, thermal stimulation, plasma, or an electrochemical process, so as to cause a crosslinking reaction of the molecular chains of said prepolymer by the action of said first crosslinking agent in said first areas subjected to said first stimulation, said first crosslinked areas obtained having a first affinity with respect to the blocks of the underlying block copolymer,subjecting the stack to a second stimulation, selected from light radiation, ion bombardment, thermal stimulation, plasma, or an electrochemical process, so as to cause a crosslinking reaction of the molecular chains of said prepolymer by the action of said second crosslinking agent in secondary areas, not crosslinked after the first stimulation, said crosslinked secondary areas obtained, adjacent to the first areas, having a second affinity with respect to the blocks of the underlying block copolymer, the second affinity being opposite to the first affinity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the interface material, used as a top coat layer on a block copolymer film, has adjacent crosslinked areas, the surface energies of which are highly contrasted and such that the affinity with respect to the blocks of the underlying block copolymer is opposite. Thus, when the block copolymer self-organizes at its own assembly temperature, the nanodomains organize perpendicularly to the interfaces or parallel to the interfaces depending on whether they are located under a neutral area or under an affine area of the crosslinked interface material. In addition, the crosslinking of the interface material allows the movement of its molecular chains to be restricted and thus the possibility of dewetting of the top coat layer to be eliminated and the underlying block copolymer film to be stabilized, so that it does not dewet from its substrate.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to other optional features of the method:the first crosslinking agent initiates crosslinking by reacting with a first crosslinkable functional group of the polymer chain, while the second crosslinking agent initiates crosslinking by reacting with a crosslinkable functional group identical to or different from the first one;one of the two crosslinking agents further reacts with at least one functional monomer of the polymer chain;either or both of the crosslinking agents is (are) carried by the polymer chain of said prepolymer;the functional monomers of the polymer chain of said prepolymer are acrylate or diacrylate or triacrylate or multi-acrylate, methacrylate, or multi-methacrylate, or polyglycidyl or vinyl, fluoroacrylate or fluoromethacrylate, vinyl fluoride or fluorostyrene, alkyl acrylate or methacrylate, hydroxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate, alkylsilyl acrylate or methacrylate derivatives, unsaturated esters/acids such as fumaric or maleic acids, vinyl carbamates and carbonates, allyl ethers, and thiol-ene systems;the crosslinkable functional group(s) of the polymer chain of said prepolymer is (are) a derivative (derivatives) having chemical functions of the epoxy/oxirane, oxetane, thiirane or vinyl ether, cyclic ether, trioxane, vinyl, lactone, lactam, carbonate, thiocarbonate, maleic anhydride, or (meth)acrylate type substituted by a carbon chain having one or more unsaturations;the crosslinking agents are selected from: acids photo-generated from a salt selected from onium salts, such as iodonium, sulfonium, pyridinium, alkoxypyridinium, phosphonium, oxonium, or diazonium salts;
